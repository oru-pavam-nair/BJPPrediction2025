The delimitation splitting the IUML stronghold of Malappuram into two weakens their chances.

Given their need for supportive Local Self Government decisions—especially on issues like tax and encroachment—the Christian community is widely expected to avoid backing a BJP-led administration in both local body and Assembly elections.

The Bon Natale festival is perceived as part of a broader attempt by Christian groups to strengthen their influence in Thrissur, including securing a Mayor aligned with their interests. Electoral data shows that, in the 32 divisions where Shri Suresh Gopi led, only eight are Hindu-dominant, with the rest being Christian-majority. Church-linked networks are reportedly working towards ensuring a UDF victory.

Within the Hindu community, there is some discomfort over the appointment of a Christian BJP district president in a region with strong Hindu sentiment.

Ward 5 was given to the BDJS, with SNDP leader P.D. Shaji contesting, while Minerva Mohanan was fielded in Kallekulam to unite SNDP, NSS, and Christian votes. Four former Janapaksham members and the entry of Panchayat President George Mathew Atyalil have strengthened the BJP’s base. The campaign has gained momentum with P.C. George, Shaun George, and Alphons Kannanthanam actively leading rallies, and leaders like Suresh Urumbikkunnel joining the party.

The BJP currently holds 2 wards - one of which has been cracked by delimitation rendering it unwinnable. The other sitting ward has been targeted by the CPM and is being contested by the local secretary making it a tight though winnable race. The incumbent UDF has not created any major anti-incumbency sentiment and appears poised to consolidate Christian and Muslim votes. The local RSS believes that ward number 3 and 10 could be competitive as they came in second place in one and the other was held by an NDA independent in 2005 though they are not likely winnable.,

While the Panchayat is demographically favourable on paper, the large Nair community supports the Kerala Congress due to the presence of MLA Shri N. Jayaraj who also happens to be related to a large number of the members of the  community. The LDF appears strong in the Panchayat and local voters believe that the LDF will win control of the Panchayat again due to strong ground work and weak UDF election machinery. The RSS believes that there are 3 winnable wards and a further 3 where it is possible to put up a strong fight. Ward number 1- the MLA's ward - is currently held by the BJP and was won despite it not being considered winnable while Ward number 3 and 16 are considered favourable. There is potential for strong fights in ward number 2,4, and 6 fdue to tSangh presence and party enthusiasm. Similarly, the CPM has a firm grasp over the local SNDP organisation. The INC and CPM had made adjustments in Ward 3 in the previous election and are expected to do the same again this time.",

BJP aims to become a decisive force by retaining Vilakkumaruth and Mugalel Peedika and has fielded candidates in all 14 wards, but it has failed to make inroads in Christian-majority areas. Interactions in Paika and Meenachil churches show no shift in Roman Catholic attitudes toward the BJP, with most Christians expected to back Kerala Congress Mani, Congress, and Kerala Congress Joseph factions. CPM candidates are contesting as independents in places like Idamattam to attract both Christian and Hindu votes. The SNDP is supporting the CPM, while NSS members favour the BJP, but these votes alone are insufficient for BJP victories.",

One seat held before by the BJP went uncontested in 2021 due to BDJS demanding the seat and relinquishing it last minute. Another seat was lost due to a factional rebel. Party cadre believes only 3 wards are completely uncompetitive. The LDF has favourable demographics and the SNDP leadership favours them although there is a split in members and consistent defections to the BJP from the community. The LDF has  rebels and the CPM and CPI are also contesting against each other. The party appears very active and is conducting several local outreach events and cadre is also extremely motivated. The LDF has had difficulty in finding  willing candidates for 2 seats and there is internal resentment in the CPM due to poor leadership. The factionalism issues within the BJP have been stamped out as well. There is strong anti-incumbency against the LDF as well as were ineffective due to relying on independent support and could not implement projects properly such as the Panchayat being the first Digital Gram Panchayat in the country.",

BJP candidates are struggling due to lack of funds. Contesting with the ‘Two Leaves’ symbol gives the Mani faction an added advantage. LDF’s efforts to gain Roman Catholic and Nair support through family meetings have influenced voters. The absence of former Panchayat President Ranjith G. Meenabhavan as a candidate has reduced BJP’s edge. While NSS and SNDP members largely support the BJP, strong Roman Catholic backing for the Mani and Congress candidates may hurt BJP even in its usual strong wards.",

However, due to issues during candidate selection, the RSS stepped away from supporting the party and this resulted in rebels in 2 sitting wards. Furthermore, one winnable ward does not have any candidate contesting for the NDA due to the aforementioned problems. Party cadre also seems demotivated due to the mistakes made during candidate selection and there is little visible activity and even posters for the party's candidates are rare. The BJP also has image issues as local leadership has been involved in a widely publicized half price for vehicles scheme where funds were collected but without any deliveries. Local party leadership has also been inattentive to organisational work as both the Jilla President and Mandalam President are contesting and focusing on their own elections - one of them contesting in the Municipality despite not being a regular resident. The LDF has been quite aggressive in its work and will likely make gains and the ruling UDF also does not have any scandals and has not created any strong anti incumbency. The local NSS is also friendly with the rebel candidates. The Party does not have an election committee office and it seems they haven't coonducted any ward convention events either. The party has also begun a public campaign against the rebel candidates making them appear sympathetic.",

Strategically placed KPMS and NSS candidates ensure vote consolidation, while former members and sitting members’ relatives contesting increase continuity and local networks.

Close previous margins suggest winnability with minimal swing. Overall, BJP is positioned to capture 8–12 seats, with a realistic possibility of crossing 11.",

The party, which held only three wards last term, now has seven seats firmly assured—Plakkode, Elayam, Wakkanadu, Gurunathanmukku, Kareepra, one Ezhava-majority ward, and Madanthankodu—driven by strong caste alignment, repeat candidates with established goodwill, and active mobilisation by temple-related organisations. In 11 wards, the contest is a direct BJP–LDF fight, where LDF retains organisational strength but faces emerging anti-incumbency and demographic disadvantages. Congress remains weak or irrelevant in most wards, reducing triangular fragmentation and working to the BJP’s benefit. The only serious constraint is the severe lack of campaign funds across wards, which has stalled even basic activities like announcements and material distribution. Despite this, BJP’s demographic alignment, candidate strength, and grassroots consolidation place the party on track for 7 assured wins and the potential to secure up to 9 seats, making Kareepra one of the more promising panchayats for the BJP in the region.",

Internal conflicts among LDF/UDF candidates, coupled with multiple candidates from the same family or community, fragment votes in BJP’s favor. Local leaders and branch secretaries of NSS, SNDP, and BDJS play a pivotal role in mobilization, particularly in wards like Kurumbaloor, Kuzhakkad, and Thekkumpuram. Historical voting patterns and the support of former members now in BJP, such as Manish, further enhance prospects. Booth-level campaigning and vote consolidation will be critical.

128,Thiruvananthapuram,Kollam West,Chavara,Kollam,Corporation,Team 4,2 December,BJP Behind,,,,,"Post-delimitation, the 56 wards of Kollam Corporation reveal a clear pattern: the BJP’s prospects are heavily shaped by internal factionalism, poor candidate selection, and caste-based vote arithmetic, while the LDF relies on incumbency and community consolidation, and the UDF struggles with weak candidates and fragmented vote bases. In several winnable wards such as Pattathanam, Vadakkavila and Ammannada, the BJP has undermined its own chances by sidelining strong candidates like Denny Sir, allegedly due to the District President’s interference and favouritism, resulting in avoidable vote erosion. Where BJP retains structural advantages, such as Palathara, Kadappakada, Uliyakovil and Kannimel West-56, outcomes hinge on micro-level caste consolidation, especially NSS and SNDP, and the involvement of influential community figures. LDF remains competitive in its strongholds like Vadakkavila, College, Uliyakovil, Thevally and Shakthikulanagara, though anti-incumbency, developmental grievances and vote splits give BJP entry points in select divisions. UDF, meanwhile, emerges largely as a spoiler, with inactive or weak candidates likely to fragment traditional Nair and minority votes, especially in Thevally, Ayathil and Punthalathazham. The clearest BJP pickup opportunities lie in Kannimel West-56, Shakthikulanagara, Punthalathazham and Vallikeezhu, provided community alliances are activated and campaign discipline is restored. Seats like Uliyakovil, Thevally and Kadappakada remain dead-heat contests, where single-digit vote shifts will decide outcomes. Overall, BJP’s electoral ceiling is shaped less by opposition strength and more by internal sabotage, mismanagement of caste equations and missed opportunities in candidate placement.
