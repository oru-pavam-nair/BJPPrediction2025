Ward 4 (earlier Ward 5) also remains tough, as the LDF councillor is popular and there is no anti-incumbency against them.

Overall, the total seat prediction for the panchayat is a dead heat, with both fronts equally placed.

The party may win only 2 to 5 of the 7 wards where it came second in 2020, mainly because of weak candidate selection in the 31st and 29th wards in the Nair and Ezhuthachan-dominated Kanniyapuram area.

Delimitation has split the IUML stronghold of Malappuram into two, weakening their position. Rumours suggest that former Congress Mandal Secretary Rafeeq is using these independent groups to target Congress Mandal President and candidate Sajan, creating a Hindu–Muslim divide within the INC in some wards.

In 2020, the NDA won 5 seats, including one NDA-backed independent in Kadamboor, and finished second in 5 wards. Although that independent has now joined the UDF, the NDA is still expected to retain 4 sitting wards and win the Hindu-dominated Aravakkad and Koonamala wards, which were narrowly lost last time. The AVM candidacy of the former CPI(M) LC Secretary in Vannivilasini also strengthens BJP prospects.

Final estimates indicate NDA 5–7 wards, INC 0–1, IUML 1–2, independents 2–4, and CPI(M) retaining the GP with around 12–13 wards due to strong organisation and limited anti-incumbency.","Under R1 Review, Under R2 Review"

These areas were usually IUML strongholds but now due to growing dissatisfaction with the UDF many of these votes are expected to move toward the LDF which is fielding several Muslim independent candidates. 
This further reduces BJP’s chances. BJP may keep two of the three seats it won in 2020 but it might lose Malajoor due to delimitation. There is a small chance of gains in Akaloor and Kilikurishimangalam but they are not strong enough to change the wider picture.

Before the new delimitation, the BJP had a strong chance of taking control of the panchayat. However, the recent delimitation has favoured the LDF and UDF in some areas, reducing BJP’s prospects. The INC has also fielded strong candidates in wards like Edakkode, which may affect BJP performance in 2–3 wards.

There is no major anti-incumbency against the current administration, but BJP’s growing influence among the youth and the popularity of central government schemes like Ayushman Bharat could give the party a slight edge, with a possible win of 8–11 wards.

Among Hindus there is some discomfort after the appointment of a Christian BJP District President in an area with strong Hindu sentiment.

Most wards in this Panchayat present head to head competitions between the BJP and LDF. The presence of the KC(M) in the LDF and the near collapse of the UDF could lead to minority potential consolidation behind the LDF. The BJP has not been able to make headway within the local SNDP community either, which is currently very close to the CPM. Local voters across wards are mostly of the opinion that the LDF will retain power due to the presence of the KC(M) and favourable ward re-delimitation. The BJP is competitive in all wards except 1,3,20,21, and 22 due to better demographics in all other wards. While ground opinions state that the LDF will likely retain power, the BJP appears poised to increase its seat tally as well.",

Joseph Attuchal has resurfaced as a key election issue likely to benefit the BJP. However, KC(M) and CPM are actively countering BJP’s rise, with MLA Sebastian Kulathunkal camping in the area to prevent a shift in Christian votes. Shone George’s intensive outreach has improved BJP’s acceptance among Christian families, and a section of NSS is supportive, but SNDP remains firmly with CPM while BDJS stays inactive, limiting BJP’s community mobilisation.",

Ward 5 was given to the BDJS, with SNDP leader P.D. Shaji contesting, while Minerva Mohanan was fielded in Kallekulam to unite SNDP, NSS, and Christian votes. Four former Janapaksham members and the entry of Panchayat President George Mathew Atyalil have strengthened the BJP’s base. The campaign has gained momentum with P.C. George, Shaun George, and Alphons Kannanthanam actively leading rallies, and leaders like Suresh Urumbikkunnel joining the party.

The BJP currently holds 2 wards - one of which has been cracked by delimitation rendering it unwinnable. The other sitting ward has been targeted by the CPM and is being contested by the local secretary making it a tight though winnable race. The incumbent UDF has not created any major anti-incumbency sentiment and appears poised to consolidate Christian and Muslim votes. The local RSS believes that ward number 3 and 10 could be competitive as they came in second place in one and the other was held by an NDA independent in 2005 though they are not likely winnable.,

While the Panchayat is demographically favourable on paper, the large Nair community supports the Kerala Congress due to the presence of MLA Shri N. Jayaraj who also happens to be related to a large number of the members of the  community. The LDF appears strong in the Panchayat and local voters believe that the LDF will win control of the Panchayat again due to strong ground work and weak UDF election machinery. The RSS believes that there are 3 winnable wards and a further 3 where it is possible to put up a strong fight. Ward number 1- the MLA's ward - is currently held by the BJP and was won despite it not being considered winnable while Ward number 3 and 16 are considered favourable. There is potential for strong fights in ward number 2,4, and 6 fdue to tSangh presence and party enthusiasm. Similarly, the CPM has a firm grasp over the local SNDP organisation.

BJP aims to become a decisive force by retaining Vilakkumaruth and Mugalel Peedika and has fielded candidates in all 14 wards, but it has failed to make inroads in Christian-majority areas. Interactions in Paika and Meenachil churches show no shift in Roman Catholic attitudes toward the BJP, with most Christians expected to back Kerala Congress Mani, Congress, and Kerala Congress Joseph factions. CPM candidates are contesting as independents in places like Idamattam to attract both Christian and Hindu votes. The SNDP is supporting the CPM, while NSS members favour the BJP, but these votes alone are insufficient for BJP victories.",

One seat held before by the BJP went uncontested in 2021 due to BDJS demanding the seat and relinquishing it last minute. Another seat was lost due to a factional rebel. Party cadre believes only 3 wards are completely uncompetitive. The LDF has favourable demographics and the SNDP leadership favours them although there is a split in members and consistent defections to the BJP from the community. The LDF has  rebels and the CPM and CPI are also contesting against each other. The party appears very active and is conducting several local outreach events and cadre is also extremely motivated. The LDF has had difficulty in finding  willing candidates for 2 seats and there is internal resentment in the CPM due to poor leadership. The factionalism issues within the BJP have been stamped out as well. There is strong anti-incumbency against the LDF as well as were ineffective due to relying on independent support and could not implement projects properly such as the Panchayat being the first Digital Gram Panchayat in the country.",

BJP candidates are struggling due to lack of funds. Contesting with the ‘Two Leaves’ symbol gives the Mani faction an added advantage. LDF’s efforts to gain Roman Catholic and Nair support through family meetings have influenced voters. The absence of former Panchayat President Ranjith G. Meenabhavan as a candidate has reduced BJP’s edge. While NSS and SNDP members largely support the BJP, strong Roman Catholic backing for the Mani and Congress candidates may hurt BJP even in its usual strong wards.",

However, due to issues during candidate selection, the RSS stepped away from supporting the party and this resulted in rebels in 2 sitting wards. Furthermore, one winnable ward does not have any candidate contesting for the NDA due to the aforementioned problems. Party cadre also seems demotivated due to the mistakes made during candidate selection and there is little visible activity and even posters for the party's candidates are rare. The BJP also has image issues as local leadership has been involved in a widely publicized half price for vehicles scheme where funds were collected but without any deliveries. Local party leadership has also been inattentive to organisational work as both the Jilla President and Mandalam President are contesting and focusing on their own elections - one of them contesting in the Municipality despite not being a regular resident. The LDF has been quite aggressive in its work and will likely make gains and the ruling UDF also does not have any scandals and has not created any strong anti incumbency. The local NSS is also friendly with the rebel candidates. The Party does not have an election committee office and it seems they haven't coonducted any ward convention events either. The party has also begun a public campaign against the rebel candidates making them appear sympathetic.",

Meanwhile, LDF and UDF are running well-funded, high-visibility campaigns. The Panchayat is predominantly NSS-majority, with Christians, SNDP, and Vishwakarma following, giving BJP a demographic advantage. Anti-incumbency sentiment and Sabarimala-related issues generate negative perception against LDF, likely converting into consolidated BJP votes. New SC/ST and women candidates face visibility challenges, but the recent inclusion of the UDF Mahila Morcha District Secretary into BJP adds momentum, especially among women voters. Several wards, including triangular contests (Wards 2, 7, 13) and previously second-place finishes (Wards 16, 17), present opportunities. With immediate funding and deployment of campaign materials, BJP can convert favorable sentiment into 8–12 seats. Timely action is crucial to counter LDF/UDF campaign advantages and secure the Panchayat administration.",

BJP, though winning three seats last term, faces internal organisational issues, factionalism, and fallout from whip violations, weakening its position. The dominance of the RSS Praudha Pramukh family in Valakom further limits BJP’s operational control. Expelled members have partially returned, but overall cohesion and public support remain low. LDF candidates are politically experienced, while most BJP candidates are new and less active. Triangular contests in key wards like Velangara and other Ummannoor areas show BJP struggling to consolidate votes. Factionalism, candidate replacements, and resentment among cadres have split the Hindu vote base. UDF’s stronghold candidates and LDF dominance, coupled with BJP’s internal fractures, restrict BJP’s realistic winning potential to few seats.",

BJP, despite pockets of strength in NSS-dominant areas, favourable SC-reserved wards, and a few constituencies where it previously finished first or second, is constrained by uneven candidate quality, limited community alignment in several wards, and the lingering organisational setback from the previous by-poll defeat. Independent candidates like Dileep, combined with UDF and LDF rebel independents, further fragment the anti-LDF space, pulling votes away from BJP in critical wards. SNDP-heavy zones and Muslim-influenced pockets also restrict BJP’s consolidation. While BJP has clear winning potential in about five wards, mainly SC-reserved, NSS-friendly, and previously competitive segments, the broader Panchayat dynamics overwhelmingly favour the LDF, making an BJP takeover unlikely.

With no major allegations against sitting members and consistently strong organisational machinery, LDF enjoys a comfortable lead in most wards. BJP, while structurally weaker, is witnessing its strongest performance so far through aggressive 25+ member squad campaigning and improved booth-level activity, helping it rise to a clear second position; however, its candidate pool is limited by narrow social influence, particularly among SNDP and Christian voters. UDF, facing weak mobilisation, low-quality candidates, and internal vote leakage, is expected to fall significantly behind, with its votes splitting toward both BJP and LDF. Given these dynamics, Pavithreshwaram is firmly an LDF-held Panchayat, with BJP improving but still far from capturing control, and UDF slipping to a distant third.",

Strong candidate selection, aligned with community considerations, has significantly improved BJP’s prospects. The panchayat’s caste composition is dominated by NSS, followed by SNDP, KPMS, and Christians. BJP has fielded politically active, prominent, and community-aligned candidates across competitive wards, including SC-reserved, SNDP-majority, Nair-majority, and mixed wards. Rebel candidates in two wards split LDF and UDF votes, further aiding BJP. Strategically placed KPMS and NSS candidates ensure vote consolidation, while former members and sitting members’ relatives contesting increase continuity and local networks. Strongholds of CPI(M) are expected to hold, but their influence does not materially affect BJP’s overall projection. Financial allegations against LDF incumbents weaken their support. Close previous margins suggest winnability with minimal swing. Overall, BJP is positioned to capture 8–12 seats, with a realistic possibility of crossing 11.",

The party, which held only three wards last term, now has seven seats firmly assured—Plakkode, Elayam, Wakkanadu, Gurunathanmukku, Kareepra, one Ezhava-majority ward, and Madanthankodu—driven by strong caste alignment, repeat candidates with established goodwill, and active mobilisation by temple-related organisations. In 11 wards, the contest is a direct BJP–LDF fight, where LDF retains organisational strength but faces emerging anti-incumbency and demographic disadvantages. Congress remains weak or irrelevant in most wards, reducing triangular fragmentation and working to the BJP’s benefit. The only serious constraint is the severe lack of campaign funds across wards, which has stalled even basic activities like announcements and material distribution. Despite this, BJP’s demographic alignment, candidate strength, and grassroots consolidation place the party on track for 7 assured wins and the potential to secure up to 9 seats, making Kareepra one of the more promising panchayats for the BJP in the region.",

Internal conflicts among LDF/UDF candidates, coupled with multiple candidates from the same family or community, fragment votes in BJP’s favor. Local leaders and branch secretaries of NSS, SNDP, and BDJS play a pivotal role in mobilization, particularly in wards like Kurumbaloor, Kuzhakkad, and Thekkumpuram. Historical voting patterns and the support of former members now in BJP, such as Manish, further enhance prospects. Booth-level campaigning and vote consolidation will be critical.

128,Thiruvananthapuram,Kollam West,Chavara,Kollam,Corporation,Team 4,2 December,BJP Behind,,,,,"Post-delimitation, the 56 wards of Kollam Corporation reveal a clear pattern: the BJP’s prospects are heavily shaped by internal factionalism, poor candidate selection, and caste-based vote arithmetic, while the LDF relies on incumbency and community consolidation, and the UDF struggles with weak candidates and fragmented vote bases. In several winnable wards such as Pattathanam, Vadakkavila and Ammannada, the BJP has undermined its own chances by sidelining strong candidates like Denny Sir, allegedly due to the District President’s interference and favouritism, resulting in avoidable vote erosion. Where BJP retains structural advantages, such as Palathara, Kadappakada, Uliyakovil and Kannimel West-56, outcomes hinge on micro-level caste consolidation, especially NSS and SNDP, and the involvement of influential community figures. LDF remains competitive in its strongholds like Vadakkavila, College, Uliyakovil, Thevally and Shakthikulanagara, though anti-incumbency, developmental grievances and vote splits give BJP entry points in select divisions. UDF, meanwhile, emerges largely as a spoiler, with inactive or weak candidates likely to fragment traditional Nair and minority votes, especially in Thevally, Ayathil and Punthalathazham. The clearest BJP pickup opportunities lie in Kannimel West-56, Shakthikulanagara, Punthalathazham and Vallikeezhu, provided community alliances are activated and campaign discipline is restored. Seats like Uliyakovil, Thevally and Kadappakada remain dead-heat contests, where single-digit vote shifts will decide outcomes. Overall, BJP’s electoral ceiling is shaped less by opposition strength and more by internal sabotage, mismanagement of caste equations and missed opportunities in candidate placement.

Key battlegrounds like Wards 2, 14 and 16 do not offer assured consolidation, Nair votes are fragmented, SC reserved Ward 14 has only moderate chances, and Ward 16 saw BJP fail to attract community support.",
