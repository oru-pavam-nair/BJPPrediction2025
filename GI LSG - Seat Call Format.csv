Ward 4 (earlier Ward 5) also remains tough, as the LDF councillor is popular and there is no anti-incumbency against them.

The BJP is benefiting from almost complete consolidation of the Hindu community, while the Muslim community strategically splits its votes between the LDF and UDF to counter the BJP, despite unfavorable demographics. The CPM is set to retain its three legacy wards, with its remaining sitting seat in a ""dead heat"" with the BJP. The UDF will not make significant gains due to the polarization in Hindu-majority wards.

At the same time, some voters are worried that the BJP is collecting funds despite being in power at the Centre.

Allegations against INC MLA Shri Rahul Mamkoothathil and the presence of multiple rebels have weakened the INC campaign. 

The LDF is expected to improve compared to last time, but the general expectation is that they will finish third with 6 to 9 wards. 

The BJP may lose the Kunnumpuram ward, which has a large Muslim vote that was earlier secured due to the personal influence of the previous councillor; after he became ill, the BJP fielded a female candidate who may not retain that vote. 

The BJP is also likely to lose Valiyapadam ward to the LDF due to the crematorium issue and the LDF fielding a candidate acceptable to the NSS, and they may also lose Vennakkara Central if a rebel BJP karyakarta manages to secure around 200 votes. 

Additionally, fielding Shri Sasikumar from the Vanika Vaishya community in Nair-dominated Koppam and Smt Mini Krishnakumar from the Nair community in Vanika Vaishya-dominated Ayyapuram East has turned what were once sure BJP seats into tight contests. 

On the other hand, the BJP is likely to win the Brahmin-dominated Noorani ward from the LDF since the sitting Brahmin councillor has become inactive and the BJP is fielding a Brahmin candidate. 

Rebel candidatures of former Palakkad DCC Member Kidhar Muhammed in Kunnathurmedu North and Safiya Mansoor, wife of popular INC councillor Mansoor, may also help the BJP win those two wards. 

There is also a small chance of winning Vadakkamuri if disgruntled INC leader Linto can be convinced to shift around 50 to 100 votes from the INC to the BJP.

Delimitation has split the IUML stronghold of Malappuram into two, weakening their position. Rumours suggest that former Congress Mandal Secretary Rafeeq is using these independent groups to target Congress Mandal President and candidate Sajan, creating a Hindu–Muslim divide within the INC in some wards.

In 2020, the NDA won 5 seats, including one NDA-backed independent in Kadamboor, and finished second in 5 wards. Although that independent has now joined the UDF, the NDA is still expected to retain 4 sitting wards and win the Hindu-dominated Aravakkad and Koonamala wards, which were narrowly lost last time. The AVM candidacy of the former CPI(M) LC Secretary in Vannivilasini also strengthens BJP prospects.

These areas were usually IUML strongholds but now due to growing dissatisfaction with the UDF many of these votes are expected to move toward the LDF which is fielding several Muslim independent candidates. 
This further reduces BJP’s chances. BJP may keep two of the three seats it won in 2020 but it might lose Malajoor due to delimitation. There is a small chance of gains in Akaloor and Kilikurishimangalam but they are not strong enough to change the wider picture.

At the same time, BJP votes have increased significantly after the Lok Sabha election, creating clear possibilities for the party to improve its seat tally this time.

Several traditional party-village pockets have weakened, leading to triangular contests in many wards, which could influence the final outcome.

The major issues highlighted by residents include the poor condition of roads in Chathakudam, Mosco Nagar, and Ilamkunnu. Additionally, the well near the Panchayath office, which had collapsed, has not been rebuilt despite repeated requests from the public — a matter causing substantial dissatisfaction among voters.",

Because these institutions depend on favourable decisions from the Local Self Government on matters like tax and encroachment the general expectation is that the Christian community will not support a BJP led administration in local or Assembly elections. The Buon Natale festival is widely seen as part of a larger effort by Christian groups to increase their influence in the Corporation including ensuring a Mayor who aligns with their interests. In the 32 divisions where Shri Suresh Gopi led only eight have a Hindu majority and the rest are Christian dominated and Church connected networks are reportedly working to ensure a UDF win. 
Among Hindus there is some discomfort after the appointment of a Christian BJP District President in an area with strong Hindu sentiment. Internal organisational issues are also affecting the party because many mandalam presidents continue to align with the former district leadership which limits the current district president’s ability to coordinate election work across divisions. Taken together these factors place the BJP behind in this Corporation.

The party earlier won 2 wards and came second in 8 and at present has clear winning potential in 8 wards with Ward 17 also looking promising because of a strong candidate. 
The overall caste and community equation works in favour of the BJP as OBC groups such as Ezhava and Viswakarma along with Nairs and SC communities form the majority while Christian voters offer partial support and the Muslim vote share is very small. 
Door to door campaigning and booth level activities are running smoothly and voters are responding positively. The only clear challenge is in Ward 7 where the LDF candidate has strong personal influence. There are some minor internal concerns related to candidate selection but the organisational structure of the BJP is functioning well. LDF remains the main opponent while UDF is weak though trying to revive itself. With focused ward level effort the BJP is in a very competitive position across the Panchayat placing Velookkara in the Deadheat category for the BJP.

The LDF still holds administrative control and benefits from a stable organisation with strong backing from Ezhava and SC ST communities. From public interactions there is mixed feedback on development activities, and Christian majority pockets continue to favour the UDF even though its organisation has weakened. The demographic pattern led by Hindu communities such as Ezhava, Nair, Vishwakarma and SC ST has a major impact on how each ward leans politically.
The BJP is growing steadily with stronger booth level organisation and more involvement in community and religious activities. Ground feedback suggests the party can increase its seat tally with at least two more wards likely to be added and improving influence in regions like Ward 2. As more wards shift into tight three corner fights among the LDF UDF and BJP the broader picture shows the LDF is likely to retain control, the BJP will make meaningful gains, and the UDF will hold on mainly in Christian dominated areas.

Interactions with local workers, shop owners, and community figures indicate that BJP’s organizational activity and influence among major Hindu communities are contributing to this momentum.
Demographic patterns and booth-level mobilisation, especially by RSS workers, have strengthened BJP’s position in wards where Hindu votes are consolidated. Community leaders hold differing opinions, but both acknowledge that BJP has expanded its ground presence compared to previous elections.
BJP is strongly placed in five wards and moderately positioned in four additional wards, giving it a realistic path to securing 8–9 seats if voter turnout and last-phase mobilisation work in its favour.

Local problems like drinking water shortage and poor roads and other basic works are angering people and are helping BJP improve compared to the last election.
The panchayat has around 60 percent Hindus, 35 percent Muslims and 15 percent Christians. Areas where most residents are Muslim still lean mainly towards LDF, but almost 50 percent of coastal Hindu voters are now expected to support BJP. At present the working estimate is BJP winning around 8 to 9 seats, LDF around 11 to 12 seats and UDF 1 or 2 seats.

Although BJP had won only 2 seats last time, it had finished second in four wards with less than 100 votes, laying the groundwork for today’s stronger presence. Field interactions across major localities indicate a sharp shift, turning the panchayat into a clear BJP–LDF direct contest, with UDF remaining largely insignificant except in one ward. While LDF still benefits from organisational depth and its earlier governance network, BJP’s expanding grassroots reach, improved Hindu consolidation, and emerging Christian support have dramatically altered the political landscape. Cross-voting trends and dissatisfaction with parts of local administration further tighten the race. With both fronts now expected to win 7–8 seats each, Karalam is heading toward a true photo-finish outcome, making the 2025 election one of the most unpredictable in its recent history.",

Ground inputs from Porathissery, town areas, Mapranam, and Kudalmanikyam show clear BJP momentum driven by anti-incumbency, corruption issues in both fronts, and favourable community behaviour. The region now functions as two major battle zones — Porathissery with a BJP–LDF fight and the town with a BJP–UDF fight — while mixed-community wards remain competitive three-cornered contests.

BJP is aiming for around 20 divisions and is gaining advantage in several wards due to stronger cadre work, Hindu consolidation, growing Christian openness, and reduced Muslim vote unity. In the town region, key divisions show a direct BJP–UDF contest, while rebel candidates and vote splits across UDF and LDF help BJP in close margins. Issues like the Karuvannur Bank Scam and cooperative-bank controversies have weakened both fronts, allowing BJP to project itself as a cleaner alternative. Overall, booth-level mobilisation and community endorsements indicate BJP is currently ahead.",

The BJP has strengthened its organisational presence and is aiming for power in 2025, while the LDF—largely driven by CPI-dominated wards—faces minor internal dissatisfaction and the impact of recent state-level issues, including the Sabarimala gold-plating controversy.

In 2020, LDF led the Panchayat with 8 seats while NDA secured 4, but current assessments indicate a major shift, with NDA expected to reach 7–8 seats. Demographically, the Panchayat comprises 72% Hindus, 20% Christians, and 8% Muslims, shaping ward-specific strategies. While the BJP is locked in a direct contest with the LDF in almost all wards, Ward 8 stands out with a BJP–UDF fight. Overall, voter sentiment points to a closely balanced scenario favouring the BJP’s upward trend.",
52,Palakkad,Thrissur South,Kodungallur,Kodungallur,Municipality,Team 12,5 December,Deadheat,20-22,19-21,0-3,,"Kodungallur has historically seen tight electoral battles, with the 2020 result split as NDA 21, LDF 22, UDF 1 out of 44 seats. This narrow gap set the stage for an equally competitive political atmosphere going into 2025.

The GI assessment was carried out across key locations including Kodungallur Temple surroundings, Methala, Thrikkulasekharapuram, Thiruvanchikulam, and the Cheraman Masjid ward, engaging voters from varied social and community backgrounds. The field outcome clearly shows a strong upward shift for the BJP, supported by improved organisational work and favourable sentiment among Hindu voters, while the LDF continues to rely on its structured cadre strength.

For 2025, with 46 seats, the current projection indicates another deadheat: NDA 20–22, LDF 19–21, UDF 0–3. However, BJP risks losing Wards 10, 19, 20, and 34 due to weaker candidates and stronger CPM alternatives. At the same time, the party is well-positioned to gain seats in Ward 29, Ward 35, and possibly additional pockets in Methala.

In summary, the on-ground GI inputs point to an extremely close NDA–LDF finish, with NDA holding a slight edge if ward-level swings and vote consolidations break in its favour.",

The BJP expects to win about 5–8 wards, especially Wards 2, 3, 15, 18, 19 and possibly 13, but weakening campaign momentum and community splits, particularly among Ezhava and Muslim voters, make the contest unpredictable. Past polarisation from the 2013 'Kodimaram' incident still shapes voter behaviour, helping the BJP consolidate considerable share of Ezhava votes in certain areas, but SNDP support remains divided and SDPI holds a firm grip in Ward 11. In sensitive wards like Ward 1, BJP’s chances depend entirely on Muslim vote division between SDPI and UDF and a partial Christian shift toward the party.

Meanwhile, LDF and UDF are running well-funded, high-visibility campaigns. The Panchayat is predominantly NSS-majority, with Christians, SNDP, and Vishwakarma following, giving BJP a demographic advantage. Anti-incumbency sentiment and Sabarimala-related issues generate negative perception against LDF, likely converting into consolidated BJP votes. New SC/ST and women candidates face visibility challenges, but the recent inclusion of the UDF Mahila Morcha District Secretary into BJP adds momentum, especially among women voters. Several wards, including triangular contests (Wards 2, 7, 13) and previously second-place finishes (Wards 16, 17), present opportunities. With immediate funding and deployment of campaign materials, BJP can convert favorable sentiment into 8–12 seats. Timely action is crucial to counter LDF/UDF campaign advantages and secure the Panchayat administration.",

BJP, though winning three seats last term, faces internal organisational issues, factionalism, and fallout from whip violations, weakening its position. The dominance of the RSS Praudha Pramukh family in Valakom further limits BJP’s operational control. Expelled members have partially returned, but overall cohesion and public support remain low. LDF candidates are politically experienced, while most BJP candidates are new and less active. Triangular contests in key wards like Velangara and other Ummannoor areas show BJP struggling to consolidate votes. Factionalism, candidate replacements, and resentment among cadres have split the Hindu vote base. UDF’s stronghold candidates and LDF dominance, coupled with BJP’s internal fractures, restrict BJP’s realistic winning potential to few seats.",

BJP, despite pockets of strength in NSS-dominant areas, favourable SC-reserved wards, and a few constituencies where it previously finished first or second, is constrained by uneven candidate quality, limited community alignment in several wards, and the lingering organisational setback from the previous by-poll defeat. Independent candidates like Dileep, combined with UDF and LDF rebel independents, further fragment the anti-LDF space, pulling votes away from BJP in critical wards. SNDP-heavy zones and Muslim-influenced pockets also restrict BJP’s consolidation. While BJP has clear winning potential in about five wards, mainly SC-reserved, NSS-friendly, and previously competitive segments, the broader Panchayat dynamics overwhelmingly favour the LDF, making an BJP takeover unlikely.

With no major allegations against sitting members and consistently strong organisational machinery, LDF enjoys a comfortable lead in most wards. BJP, while structurally weaker, is witnessing its strongest performance so far through aggressive 25+ member squad campaigning and improved booth-level activity, helping it rise to a clear second position; however, its candidate pool is limited by narrow social influence, particularly among SNDP and Christian voters. UDF, facing weak mobilisation, low-quality candidates, and internal vote leakage, is expected to fall significantly behind, with its votes splitting toward both BJP and LDF. Given these dynamics, Pavithreshwaram is firmly an LDF-held Panchayat, with BJP improving but still far from capturing control, and UDF slipping to a distant third.",

Strong candidate selection, aligned with community considerations, has significantly improved BJP’s prospects. The panchayat’s caste composition is dominated by NSS, followed by SNDP, KPMS, and Christians. BJP has fielded politically active, prominent, and community-aligned candidates across competitive wards, including SC-reserved, SNDP-majority, Nair-majority, and mixed wards. Rebel candidates in two wards split LDF and UDF votes, further aiding BJP. Strategically placed KPMS and NSS candidates ensure vote consolidation, while former members and sitting members’ relatives contesting increase continuity and local networks. Strongholds of CPI(M) are expected to hold, but their influence does not materially affect BJP’s overall projection. Financial allegations against LDF incumbents weaken their support. Close previous margins suggest winnability with minimal swing. Overall, BJP is positioned to capture 8–12 seats, with a realistic possibility of crossing 11.",

The party, which held only three wards last term, now has seven seats firmly assured—Plakkode, Elayam, Wakkanadu, Gurunathanmukku, Kareepra, one Ezhava-majority ward, and Madanthankodu—driven by strong caste alignment, repeat candidates with established goodwill, and active mobilisation by temple-related organisations. In 11 wards, the contest is a direct BJP–LDF fight, where LDF retains organisational strength but faces emerging anti-incumbency and demographic disadvantages. Congress remains weak or irrelevant in most wards, reducing triangular fragmentation and working to the BJP’s benefit. The only serious constraint is the severe lack of campaign funds across wards, which has stalled even basic activities like announcements and material distribution. Despite this, BJP’s demographic alignment, candidate strength, and grassroots consolidation place the party on track for 7 assured wins and the potential to secure up to 9 seats, making Kareepra one of the more promising panchayats for the BJP in the region.",

Key factors favoring BJP include strong NSS vote bases, splits within LDF and UDF, community alignment in SC, SNDP, and Christian-dominated wards, and allegations against incumbents that reduce voter confidence. Internal conflicts among LDF/UDF candidates, coupled with multiple candidates from the same family or community, fragment votes in BJP’s favor. Local leaders and branch secretaries of NSS, SNDP, and BDJS play a pivotal role in mobilization, particularly in wards like Kurumbaloor, Kuzhakkad, and Thekkumpuram. Historical voting patterns and the support of former members now in BJP, such as Manish, further enhance prospects. Booth-level campaigning and vote consolidation will be critical.

In several winnable wards such as Pattathanam, Vadakkavila and Ammannada, the BJP has undermined its own chances by sidelining strong candidates like Denny Sir, allegedly due to the District President’s interference and favouritism, resulting in avoidable vote erosion. Where BJP retains structural advantages, such as Palathara, Kadappakada, Uliyakovil and Kannimel West-56, outcomes hinge on micro-level caste consolidation, especially NSS and SNDP, and the involvement of influential community figures. LDF remains competitive in its strongholds like Vadakkavila, College, Uliyakovil, Thevally and Shakthikulanagara, though anti-incumbency, developmental grievances and vote splits give BJP entry points in select divisions. UDF, meanwhile, emerges largely as a spoiler, with inactive or weak candidates likely to fragment traditional Nair and minority votes, especially in Thevally, Ayathil and Punthalathazham. The clearest BJP pickup opportunities lie in Kannimel West-56, Shakthikulanagara, Punthalathazham and Vallikeezhu, provided community alliances are activated and campaign discipline is restored. Seats like Uliyakovil, Thevally and Kadappakada remain dead-heat contests, where single-digit vote shifts will decide outcomes. Overall, BJP’s electoral ceiling is shaped less by opposition strength and more by internal sabotage, mismanagement of caste equations and missed opportunities in candidate placement.

159,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Aruvikkara,Vellanad,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,2 December,BJP Behind,6,5,9,0,"historically Vellanad is not a pro-BJP panchayat; in 2020 BJP won just one seat.
BJP’s rise is real, the party placed first/second in multiple wards in 2015 and 2020 and shows consistent seat growth, but it still lacks the final consolidation required to cross 50%.
The unfulfilled township promise in Ward 4 and poor governance in Veliynnur create genuine anti-incumbency, but these votes may split between LDF and UDF rather than consolidate fully behind BJP. Caste arithmetic is mixed: Nairs  with NSS backing NSS leaning BJP in parts Nadar Christians and minorities mostly with UDF
SC/Christian clusters remain non-BJP.
Multi-corner fights in wards like 17 (Veerashaiva bloc), and multiple wards with UDF–LDF competition dilute BJP gains.",
160,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Balaramapuram,Balaramapuram,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,4 December,Deadheat,7 - 8 ,8 - 10,4 - 5,0 - 2,"LDF is currently positioned strongest in the panchayat. BJP is projected to secure around 7–8 seats but faces a clear ceiling, as Muslim voters consistently align with UDF or LDF. Although UDF presently controls the panchayat, several wards show a discernible shift toward LDF, supported by stronger ground-level mobilisation. UDF remains competitive, but LDF appears better placed to consolidate emerging voter sentiment. BJP’s scope for expansion beyond its core wards remains limited due to demographic realities, and broader socio-political issues, such as Sabarimala swarnapali, do not significantly influence voter behaviour. Instead, preferences are largely driven by individual candidates rather than issue-based alignment. However, competittive fight by BJP can be expected.",
161,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Balaramapuram,Kottukal,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,4 December,BJP Behind,3 - 4,7 - 8 ,10,0 - 2,"Current assessments indicate a slight edge for the UDF, which is expected to secure around 10 seats, with the LDF likely at seven and the BJP at 2–5. UDF appears to be benefitting from coordinated efforts and strong candidate placement. BJP’s performance, despite having favourable community pockets, is affected by less campaign efforts. ",
162,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Kattakkada,Maranallur,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,4 December,Deadheat,8 - 9,8  - 9,4 - 5,0,"The panchayat’s voter profile comprises roughly 50% Nadars, 20–30% Nairs, 15% SNDP/Ezhavas, 5% Latin Catholics, and a small Muslim population. Nadar Hindu support for BJP remains selective and largely tied to individual candidates. Contest patterns vary, with some wards seeing direct BJP–UDF contests, others BJP–LDF, and a few triangular fights.  Local interactions indicate that electoral behaviour is shaped more by caste dynamics and candidate-level engagement than by broader infrastructure or socio-economic issues.",
163,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Kattakkada,Vilappil,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,2 December,Deadheat,8 - 10,8,5,0,"Several multi-corner fights (e.g., SC woman-reserved Vilappilsala where vote trading likely).
Fragmented Hindu vote patterns in Velamkadavu, and Mayiladi (weak wards).
LDF and UDF both alive in several central wards, making the arithmetic unpredictable. Field mapping shows 8–10 strong or strong-lean BJP wards:
Nooriyod (70%), Karode (95%), Puttumelkonam, Cherukode, Karuvilanchi (triangular), Chovallur (Christian-independent backed by BJP). Christian-backed independent in Chovallur improves BJP’s prospects but does not guarantee shift in nearby wards. The multi-front balance means BJP is competitive in many wards but the combined UDF+LDF/independent presence still gives BJP a small gap to close , close outcome but BJP slightly behind in aggregate. Local issues (waste management, roads) are likely to swing marginal wards.",
164,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Kovalam,Kalliyoor,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,5 December,Deadheat,12 - 15,10 -  12,3 - 4,0," Kalliyoor is a segmented electorate (NSS ~40%, SNDP ~30%, Nadars 15–20%, SC ~5% and a notable Muslim presence, Shanthivila ward ~450 Muslim voters). Current projections place BJP at 12–15 seats, LDF 10–12, and UDF 3–4. Pakalloor shows strong SNDP influence (~60%) with two SNDP-backed candidates; SNDP support otherwise varies by ward. Several wards were decided by very narrow margins previously (three <50 votes, four <100 votes), and the presence of BJP rebels in Poonkulam and Signal Station — plus an independent (Shailaja) in Office ward — increases uncertainty (Signal Station swung from +376 in 2015 to -3 in 2020). Field reports note possible LDF→UDF cross-voting in Kuzhithalachal, anti-incumbency sentiment locally, Chenkodu as a BJP stronghold, and a likely UDF edge in the SC-reserved Hospital ward where younger voters favour the UDF candidate. Respondents said post-2020 LDF–UDF power-sharing and perceived governance issues are shaping voter sentiment; BJP is focusing its campaign on local governance themes which may yield results. BJP is slightly ahead in this panchayat, however a deadheat situation due to strong  two way contest.",
165,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Kovalam,Venganoor,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,5 December,Deadheat,8 - 9,8 - 9,5 - 6,0,"    A strong triangular contest is expected here. UDF may secure the Nadar christian votes, Nadar hindus will majorly support BJP, while due to the vote split, BJP tends to remain in the third position in some pockets.",
166,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Malayinkeezhu,Malayinkeezhu,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,2 December,BJP Behind,5 - 6,10,6 - 7,0,"Malayinkeezhu has a large Nair majority (around 60%), but the traditional local dynamic here does not fully consolidate in favour of the BJP unlike neighbouring Vilappil-vilavoorkal belt. A portion of Nair votes, even though culturally inclined towards BJP issues, still splits between UDF and LDF due to strong personal networks and old political loyalties. BJP is competitive in several wards but not ahead overall.",
167,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Malayinkeezhu,Pallichal,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,4 December,BJP Behind,2,10 - 12,8,0,"BJP’s decline from previous strength reflects dissatisfaction over candidate selection and the absence of familiar local leaders, which has weakened their standing even in traditional areas. LDF’s organisational gaps have redirected advantage toward UDF, while voter feedback emphasises candidate preference over broader issues. These dynamics collectively place BJP behind.",
168,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Malayinkeezhu,Vilavoorkal,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,2 December,BJP Ahead,9,6,5,0,"Vilavoorkal has strong structural conditions favouring BJP:75% Hindu population, 40%+ Nair share, strong NSS backing.
Field data shows 10 winnable wards where BJP workers and booth-level teams are active. Anti-incumbency against LDF is severe: LIFE housing not implemented, no major development, significant public anger in interior wards. UDF’s advantage in Christian-majority wards (12, 17, 13) limits BJP from sweeping, but does not affect the larger Hindu-majority blocks.",
169,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Neyyattinkara,Athiyannoor,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,5 December,Deadheat,5 - 6,5 - 6,5 - 6,0," In Athiyannur, the field inputs suggest that the BJP is projected to get an estimated 5-6 seats, while the LDF is expected to secure around 5-6 seats and the UDF about 5-6 seats.     A strong triangular contest is expected here. UDF may secure the Nadar christian votes, Nadar hindus will majorly support BJP, while due to the vote split, BJP tends to remain in the third position in some pockets.",
170,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Neyyattinkara,Neyattinkara,Municipality,Team 10,5 December,BJP Behind,12 - 15,18 - 20,15 - 17,0,"The electorate is dominated by Nairs (55%), followed by Ezhavas (15%), Nadars (10%), and SCs (5%). The Vazhathur NSS unit is reportedly favouring the Congress. Tight fights are noted in Koottappana, Alummood, Gramam, Maruthathoor, and Rameshwaram wards, with some signs of cross-voting between UDF and LDF supporters. Capitlising on the current governance problmes in municipality remains as a huddle for BJP to leverage the votes.",
171,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Parassala,Kollayil,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,3 December,BJP Behind,4-5,7-8,5,0,"Local dynamics present a challenge. Wards 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 are witnessing intense triangular contests and tight fights, indicating a highly volatile electorate. Nadar christian votes which comes above 50 percent lean towards UDF.",
172,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Parassala,Perumkadavila,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,3 December,Deadheat,6-7,6,4,0," While there is significant optimism regarding Aruvippuram and general seats, operational challenges in candidate selection (Wards 9 and 14) and strong triangular contests in other wards have leveled the playing field.",
173,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Vellarada,Aryankode,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,3 December,BJP Behind,2-4,8-9,4,0,"three wards (7, 8 and 12) are structurally weak, with Ward 12 remaining a firm CPM stronghold. Key battlegrounds like Wards 2, 14 and 16 do not offer assured consolidation, Nair votes are fragmented, SC reserved Ward 14 has only moderate chances, and Ward 16 saw BJP fail to attract community support.",
174,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Vellarada,Kallikkadu,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,3 December,BJP Ahead,7-8,3,3,0,"A positive shift in voter sentiment is evident, particularly with the reduction of historical aversion within the Nadar community. A  performance (10 seats) supported by consolidated Nair votes.",
175,Thiruvananthapuram,Thiruvananthapuram South,Vellarada,Ottasekaramangalam,Grama Panchayat,Team 10,3 December,BJP Behind,3-4,4,5 - 6,0,"Structural hurdles in regaining lost ground (from 4 seats in 2015 down to 2 in 2020). Wards 7, 8, and 12 remain challenging strongholds for the opposition, and the necessary consolidation of Nair and SC community votes has yet to fully materialize.",
